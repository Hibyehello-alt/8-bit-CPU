# 8-bit-CPU
A work-in-progress 8 bit cpu, made in Sebastian Lague's _Digital Logic Sim_.

I've never made a CPU before so I decided to start from scratch and am still learning how it all comes together.

# Progress

# To Use
Either clone or copy this project into [Unity PersistantDataPath](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Application-persistentDataPath.html)/Digital Logic Sim/V1/Projects. Then you can just open Digital Logic Sim and it will appear as "8-Bit-CPU"
